AWACHIDORI grows in wild only in a special part of the Boso-peninsula of Chiba prefecture, Japan. Today, due to the overhunting, we rarely see them in the wild. Sadly, it is now categorized as an endangered species. In our farm, after 35years of breed improvement, it has now become stronger and various orchid than ever drawing attention from around the world.  There are UCHORAN, KUROKAMIRAN and SATSUMACHIDORI in the same group and with these bases; we have improved our YUMECHIDORI to have more flowers.

### Planting the flower bulbs
We replace and plant during their dormant period. (Usually within December to March)

### Pots
A small plastic or pots that are not easily dried are recommended. Recommended number of bulbs would be one to two for 6cm diameter pot, three to five for the 7.5cm diameter pot and ten to fifteen for 10cm diameter pot.

### Soils
Well-drained rice-to-bean-sized pumice stones, Akadama (granular clay like mineral that is used as soil) and bog moss.

### Recommended places
Bright place outside where it can avoid rain and strong wind. In the summer time, relocate it in the cooler place. You can take them inside for about a month when they bloom.

### Watering
After the sprout to flowering, a constant watering is necessary when you see the surface of the soil dried. After flowering, a good watering is appreciated after the soil dries up. During the high temperature season, it is best to water during early evening or at night.

In October to December, the surface part will become yellow and die. From this period to around March, you don't need to water but place them in non-freezing place and spraying a mist of water once a month will be a good treatment.

Indoor, a cup and a spoon are useful to water them.

### Fertilizing
The ideal fertilizing is 2 to 4 times per month of thinned liquid fertilizer. During the high temperature season, above 30 degrees Celsius, fertilization is not necessary.

### Disease and pest
For gray mold incidence (botrytis rot) where the flower dies from the root: 2 to 3 times per month of fungicide treatment during May and June. Cutworm and caterpillars: find them and remove them

### Others
+ Try to avoid late spring frost and freezing after seeing the buds.
+ Watering should be done in early evening or at night during the high temperature season (above 30 degrees Celsius).
+ Try to avoid extreme icing (freezing) in the winter.
