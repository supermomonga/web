This new type of EBINE is improved as a colorful orchid, which you can grow in your garden and enjoy in the temperate area in the world. It is stronger and easier to grow than the wild EBINE and you will be able to enjoy the colorful flowers for long period of time. It is also known as Calanthe, the world's most various orchids. Unlike cloned plants, the "Spring Calanthe" is made from seed plantings, which means that it is the only one in the world. Just like naming a pet, you can enjoy the one-of-the kind flower.

### Recommended places
For both potted or gardened, avoid shadowy area nor under all day of direct sunlight. It grows best in the bright shade with occasional sunlight.

### Watering
Wait until the surface is dry and give enough water. In case of planting in the garden, after the roots have fairly grown, unless it becomes very dry, you won't need to water them too much.

### Fertilizing
After the flowering, a thinned conventional liquid fertilizer will be appreciated. The solid type fertilizers are also effective.

### Pottiong
When the roots fill the pot, you will need to prepare a bigger pot with AKADAMA (granular clay like mineral that is used as soil) and some pumice stones.

### Gardening
The best timing to plant in the garden will be right after flowering. Take it from the pot and without loosening the roots, go ahead and plant it in your garden.

A good EBINE will bloom every year without special treatment but [if you want to grow it like the professionals, we will be happy to share our useful information.](/growings_calanthe/growing_calanthe_spring)
